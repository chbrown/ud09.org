      <li><b>THIS WEEK</b>, February 26th - March 2nd, the University is coordinating the <a href="https://udallas.edu/cor-challenge/">Cor Challenge</a> to increase the percentage of alumni who give to UD</li>
      <li>The reunion class that has the highest percentage of giving will win a full open bar at the University hosted reunion party on Saturday evening of Alumni weekend (as opposed to just beer and wine).</li>
      <li>It doesn’t matter how much you give, just how many of us give, so really, any amount counts!</li>
      <li>Did you know? The alumni giving rate is an important indicator of a university’s financial health and factors heavily into ratings. A healthy giving rate is also an important factor that major donors, corporations, and foundations look at when considering investing in a university like UD. It’s also is a natural indicator of school pride! Let’s help make UD’s rate reflect how much we love the place, and how excited we are for our reunion!</li>
